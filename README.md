# SR_Project

## Description
This project is for Speech Recognition course. I have explored the Wav2Seq model by facebook, Kaldi, Espnet projects and trained some models and tested it. I have also explored DeepSpeech from Mozilla, Flashlight, NeMo too; however, they are not in this repo, because there were many issues about instalation and building the project. 

## Notebook-01
The first notebook(numbered: 01) is for data exploration of Common Voice for Turkish langauge.

## Notebook-02
The second notebook(numbered: 02) is training (fine-tuning) of the Wav2Seq model using Transformers and both new and old version of Common Voice data has been tested, ofcourse, the new version which has more data has performed better. 

## Notebook-03
The third notebook (numbered: 03) is for exploration of Espnet tool, the data for training has been taken from Espnet too (an4). Then, it was trained using the tools that Espnet provides. 


## Notebook-04
The fourth notebook (numbered: 04) exploration of Kaldi which involves setting up in the Google Colab too. The most of exploration is not shown in the repo, because it has been done in the local machine.
